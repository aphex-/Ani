Ani
===

A simple animation tool for Java applications.

This library contains an AbstractAnimation to inherit from. It helps to create animations by providing start, duration, progress, finish and a on finish listener.

The AnimationController helps to control multiple animations. It can update itself by an interval or by your program (e.g. every render frame).
